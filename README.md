# Linux API Examples

This repo exists to maintain example code for my professional development. Most of these were *found* on the internet. Clearly, the `tlpi-dist` folder contains the source from *The Linux Programming Interface*. This repo contrasts with the linux-driver-examples repo. sysfshello may be relocated to that repo...


**Enjoy!!**
